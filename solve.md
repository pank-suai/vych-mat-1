// Точность

```kotlin

    data["x"]?.add(x)
    data["y"]?.add(y)
    data["a"]?.add(a)

    if (abs(y) < epsilon) break

    if (func(a) * y < 0) {

### Метод Ньютона


```kotlin
val dataNuton = mapOf(
    "x" to mutableListOf<Double>(),
    "y" to mutableListOf<Double>()
)

val dirrative = { x: Double -> 3 * x * x + sin(x) }
val dir2 = {x: Double -> 6 * x + cos(x) }
```


```kotlin
var x = 0.5
var y = func(x)

dataNuton["x"]?.add(x)
dataNuton["y"]?.add(y)


while (true) {
    x = x - func(x) / dirrative(x)
    y = func(x)

    dataNuton["x"]?.add(x)
    dataNuton["y"]?.add(y)

    if (abs(y) < epsilon) break
}

```


```kotlin
val df = dataNuton.toDataFrame().addId("n")
df
```
